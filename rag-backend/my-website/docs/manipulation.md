# Manipulation and Control in Humanoid Robots

Manipulation refers to the ability of humanoid robots to interact with objects in their environment using their arms and hands. This requires precise control systems and understanding of object properties.

## Key Components

### End Effectors

Humanoid robots may have different types of end effectors:

- **Simple grippers**: Basic two-fingered or multi-fingered grippers
- **Anthropomorphic hands**: Hands designed to mimic human hands with multiple degrees of freedom
- **Specialized tools**: Task-specific end effectors

### Control Systems

#### Impedance Control

Impedance control treats the robot as a mechanical system with adjustable stiffness, damping, and inertia properties, allowing for compliant and safe interaction with the environment.

#### Force Control

Force control involves directly controlling the forces applied by the robot to objects in its environment, often used in assembly tasks or when interacting with delicate objects.

## Challenges

- **Dexterity**: Achieving human-like manipulation capabilities
- **Compliance**: Safe interaction with humans and environment
- **Real-time processing**: Making decisions quickly enough for stable manipulation
- **Multi-modal sensing**: Integrating visual, tactile, and other sensory information
